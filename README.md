# ErudaBrowser

![CI](https://github.com/kmedya-dev/erudabrowser/actions/workflows/erudabrowser.yml/badge.svg)

ErudaBrowser is a lightweight, 100% Java-free Android WebView browser application. It's designed for developers and users who want a simple browsing experience with access to a JavaScript console for debugging, thanks to the integrated Eruda.js library. The app is built using a Python-centric stack, making it a great choice for Python developers looking to get into mobile app development.

## Project Details

*   **Application Name:** ErudaBrowser
*   **Platform:** Android
*   **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript
*   **Core Technologies:** Kivy, Buildozer, Eruda.js
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Dynamic URL loading
    *   Eruda.js console for JavaScript debugging
    *   Offline and online browsing capabilities
    *   Light, dark, and system theme support
    *   Automated APK builds and releases via GitHub Actions

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

```
ErudaBrowser/
├── main.py                          # The main application entry point, written in Python with Kivy. This file creates the WebView and handles the UI.
├── assets/
│   └── index.html                   # The default HTML page loaded by the WebView. It includes the Eruda.js integration and the theme switcher.
├── manifest.json                    # The application's manifest file, containing metadata such as the app name, version, and permissions.
├── requirements.txt                 # A list of the Python dependencies required for the project (Kivy and the Kivy-Garden WebView).
├── README.md                        # This file, providing an overview of the project.
├── .gitignore                       # A file that tells Git which files and directories to ignore.
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── erudabrowser.yml         # The GitHub Actions workflow for automatically building and releasing the Android APK.
├── build.sh                         # A shell script for building the APK in a Termux environment.
├── buildozer.spec                   # Buildozer configuration file for Android packaging.
├── push.sh                          # Shell script used to push the APK to a connected device.
├── .buildozer/                      # Directory generated by Buildozer containing temporary build files.
└── bin/                             # Directory where the final APKs are stored after a successful build.
```

## How to Build

### In Termux

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pkg install python git
    pip install buildozer
    ```
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd ErudaBrowser
    ```
3.  **Build the APK:**
    ```bash
    ./build.sh
    ```
    This will use the `default` profile. If you have a custom profile (e.g., `demo`), you can specify it:
    ```bash
    ./build.sh demo
    ```
    The APKs will be located in the `bin/` directory.

### With GitHub Actions

The project uses GitHub Actions for automated builds and releases.

*   **Debug APKs:** A debug APK is automatically built on every push to the `main` branch. You can find the build artifacts (including the debug APK and build logs) in the "Actions" tab of the GitHub repository, under the "Build ErudaBrowser APK" workflow runs.
*   **Release APKs:** A signed and zipalign-aligned release APK is built and attached to a GitHub Release when a tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`) is pushed to the repository.
*   **Manual Trigger:** You can also manually trigger a build from the "Actions" tab, selecting the "Build ErudaBrowser APK" workflow and choosing a specific build profile if desired.
